# face expression recognition using CNN
face expression recognition is a dataset consisting of over 30000 (48 x 48) grayscale images in 6 different classes 
(angry,fear,happy,neutral,sad and surprise) with 3000-5000 images per class in training folder and testing folder. 
In this tutorial, I have used the face expression recognition is a dataset to train a convolutional neural network model to 
predict the type of a face expression and its percentage of accuracy.

### Python Modules used in this project

- numpy
- pandas
- Tensor flow
- keras from Tensor flow
- PIL

### Files
- training model.ipynb is a training file in which we train the model with the dataset.
- prediction model.ipynb is a prediction file in which we predict the type of a face expression.
